# Attribution model for Marketing Analysis

An attribution model is a framework used in marketing and analytics to assign credit to various touchpoints along a customer's journey that lead to a desired outcome, such as a conversion or sale. In the complex landscape of digital marketing, customers often interact with multiple channels and touchpoints before making a purchase or completing a desired action. Attribution models help businesses understand which marketing channels or touchpoints are most influential in driving conversions.

Some Attribution models I used:

#Last Interaction (or Last Click): This model gives all the credit for a conversion to the last touchpoint that the customer interacted with before converting. It's straightforward but can overlook earlier touchpoints that contributed to the conversion.

#First Interaction (or First Click): In contrast to the last interaction model, this model gives all the credit to the first touchpoint that introduced the customer to the product or service. It's useful for understanding how customers initially discover a brand.

#Linear: The linear attribution model distributes credit equally across all touchpoints in the customer journey. It's helpful for giving each touchpoint some recognition but may not accurately reflect the varying impact of different channels.

#Time Decay: This model gives more credit to touchpoints that are closer in time to the conversion. Touchpoints that occur further back in time receive less credit. It's based on the assumption that interactions closer to the conversion are more influential.

#Position-Based (U-Shaped): Also known as the U-shaped model, this attribution model assigns 40% of the credit to both the first and last touchpoints, with the remaining 20% distributed evenly among the intermediate touchpoints. It recognizes both the initial discovery and the final decision-making stages.

#Custom Models: Some businesses develop custom attribution models tailored to their specific needs and understanding of their customer journey. These models often combine elements of various standard models or incorporate additional factors unique to the business.
